# Executive Summary
Cloud providers like Azure, Google, and AWS have changed the way organizations build out their infrastructure. By nature, the cloud tends to be more "open" due to the fact that it is operating on shared hardware owned by someone else (the cloud provider). This can present risks, though. One of the risks that has been widely publicized is that of overly permissive S3 buckets in AWS. There are plenty of news stories about data being leaked via an S3 bucket that was publicly shared unintentionally.
